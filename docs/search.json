Summary Statistical TestName statistical test: Welch Two Sample t-test (also known independent samples t-test unequal variances).Purpose: test used compare means two independent groups (case, exam_1_score exam_2_score) determine ’s statistically significant difference . Welch’s t-test particularly useful assume two groups equal variances.Key assumptions:data group approximately normally distributed.two groups independent.data continuous.### 2. Appropriateness Statistical Teston context, Welch Two Sample t-test seems generally appropriate. instructor wants compare means two exam scores, continuous variables. scores exam 1 related scores exam 2, independence seems likely hold. assumption normality data may need checked (discussed ).### 3. Suggestions Checking Assumptions Statistical Testfully trusting results, ’s important check assumptions t-test:Normality:Graphical Method (Recommended): Create histograms Q-Q plots exam_1_score exam_2_score variables separately.Histograms: Look approximate bell-shaped distributions. Significant skewness multiple peaks indicate violation normality.Q-Q Plots: data approximately normally distributed, points Q-Q plot fall close straight diagonal line. Deviations line, especially ends, suggest non-normality.Formal Test (Use caution): use Shapiro-Wilk test normality variable.

Summary of the Statistical Test #>  #> *   **Name of the statistical test:** Welch Two Sample t-test (also known as the independent samples t-test with unequal variances). #> *   **Purpose:** This test is used to compare the means of two independent groups (in this case, `exam_1_score` and `exam_2_score`) to determine if there's a statistically significant difference between them. The Welch's t-test is particularly useful when you *cannot* assume that the two groups have equal variances. #> *   **Key assumptions:** #>     *   The data in each group are approximately normally distributed. #>     *   The two groups are independent. #>     *   The data are continuous. #>  #> ### 2. Appropriateness of the Statistical Test #>  #> Based on the context, the Welch Two Sample t-test seems *generally* appropriate. The instructor wants to compare the means of two exam scores, which are continuous variables. The scores from exam 1 should not be related to the scores from exam 2, so independence seems likely to hold. The assumption of normality of the data may need to be checked (as discussed below). #>  #> ### 3. Suggestions for Checking Assumptions of the Statistical Test #>  #> Before fully trusting the results, it's important to check the assumptions of the t-test: #>  #> *   **Normality:** #>     *   **Graphical Method (Recommended):** Create histograms and Q-Q plots for *each* of the `exam_1_score` and `exam_2_score` variables separately. #>         *   **Histograms:** Look for approximate bell-shaped distributions.  Significant skewness or multiple peaks could indicate a violation of normality. #>         *   **Q-Q Plots:**  If the data are approximately normally distributed, the points on the Q-Q plot should fall close to a straight diagonal line.  Deviations from the line, especially at the ends, suggest non-normality. #>     *   **Formal Test (Use with caution):** You could use the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality on each variable. However, be aware that these tests can be sensitive to even small departures from normality, especially with larger sample sizes, and may lead to the rejection of normality even when the violation is not practically significant. #> *   **Independence:** The context suggests the data are independent, but it's important to confirm that there is no relationship between the two groups of scores other than them being scores from the same student. #> *   **Equality of variances:** Although the Welch test does not require the assumption of equal variances, it is good to examine them to ensure that they are not drastically different. The ratio of the variances should ideally be less than 3. #>  #> ### 4. Interpretation of the Output #>  #> Here's a breakdown of the R output: #>  #> *   **`t = -0.33602`**: This is the calculated t-statistic. It represents the difference between the sample means relative to the estimated standard error of the difference. In this case, it's a relatively small negative value, suggesting that the difference between the sample means is small relative to the variability in the data. #>  #> *   **`df = 27.307`**: This is the degrees of freedom for the t-test. Because this is the Welch's t-test (which does not assume equal variance), the degrees of freedom are not simply `n1 + n2 - 2`. Instead, the degrees of freedom are adjusted to account for the differing variances. #>  #> *   **`p-value = 0.7394`**: This is the p-value associated with the t-test. It represents the probability of observing a t-statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one calculated (-0.33602), *assuming that there is no true difference in the means of the two exam scores (i.e., assuming the null hypothesis is true)*.  In other words, if the two exams were truly equally difficult, there's a 73.94% chance of seeing a difference in average scores as big as, or bigger than, what we observed in this sample. #>  #> *   **`alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0`**: This states the alternative hypothesis being tested. In this case, it's a two-sided test, meaning we're checking if the means are different in *either* direction (exam 1 is harder OR exam 2 is harder). #>  #> *   **`95 percent confidence interval: -9.322782  6.697782`**: This is the 95% confidence interval for the *difference* in the means (`mean of x` - `mean of y`). It estimates the range within which the *true* difference in population means likely falls, with 95% confidence. #>     *   Specifically, we are 95% confident that the true difference in the means of the two exam scores falls between -9.32 and 6.70 points. #>     *   Since this interval *includes 0*, it suggests that a difference of zero between the means is plausible. #>  #> *   **`sample estimates: mean of x = 78.1250, mean of y = 79.4375`**: These are the sample means for each group. #>     *   The mean score on exam 1 is 78.125. #>     *   The mean score on exam 2 is 79.4375. #>     *   The difference is 78.125 - 79.4375 = -1.3125 #>  #> ### 5. Overall conclusion #>  #> Given a typical significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$, and a p-value of 0.7394, we *fail to reject the null hypothesis*. There is *insufficient* evidence to conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in the means of the two exam scores. In other words, based on this data, we cannot conclude that one exam is significantly harder or easier than the other. #>  #> ### 6.
