Summary of the Statistical Model:\\n\\n*   **Name:** This is a linear regression model.\\n*   **Purpose:** Linear regression is used to model the relationship between a continuous response variable (in this case, `Sales`) and one or more predictor variables (also known as independent variables). The goal is to find the best-fitting linear equation to describe how the response variable changes with changes in the predictor variables. In this case, the model attempts to explain and predict car seat sales based on factors like competitor price, income, advertising budget, population, the company's own price, shelf location, age, education, urban/rural location, US location, and also considers the interactions between income and advertising, as well as price and age.\\n*   **Key Assumptions:** Linear regression relies on several key assumptions:\\n    *   **Linearity:** The relationship between the predictors and the response is linear.\\n    *   **Independence:** The errors (residuals) are independent of each other. This means that the error for one observation should not predict the error for another observation.\\n    *   **Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance):** The variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the predictor variables. In simpler terms, the spread of the residuals should be roughly the same for all predicted values.\\n    *   **Normality:** The errors are normally distributed. This assumption is most important for hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals.\\n\\n### 2. Appropriateness of the Statistical Model:\\n\\nBased on the description of the data and variables, linear regression *might* be appropriate. The response variable, `Sales`, is continuous, which is suitable for linear regression. The predictor variables are a mix of continuous (e.g., `Income`, `Advertising`, `Price`, `Age`) and categorical variables (e.g., `ShelveLoc`, `Urban`, `US`), which can be accommodated in a linear regression model. The interaction terms `Income:Advertising` and `Price:Age` allow for the possibility that the effect of `Income` depends on the level of `Advertising`, and that the effect of `Price` depends on `Age`.\\n\\nHowever, it is important to examine whether the linearity assumption holds for all the continuous predictors. While categorical predictors can be used directly, the continuous variables require further investigation to ensure a linear relationship. Visualizations (explained in the next section) are essential.\\n\\n### 3. Suggestions for Checking Assumptions of the Statistical Model:\\n\\nIt is crucial to check the assumptions of the linear regression model to ensure the validity of the results. Here's how:\\n\\n*   **Residual Plots:**  These are the most important diagnostic tools.\\n    *   **Residuals vs. Fitted Values:**  This plot helps assess linearity and homoscedasticity.\\n        *   *Linearity:* Look for a random scatter of points around zero.  A non-linear pattern (e.g., a curve) suggests that the linear model is not appropriate and that a transformation of the predictors or the response variable might be needed.\\n        *   *Homoscedasticity:*  The spread of the residuals should be roughly constant across the range of fitted values.  Funnel shapes (where the spread increases or decreases as the fitted values change) indicate heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance).  If you observe heteroscedasticity, consider transforming the response variable (e.g., using a logarithmic transformation) or using weighted least squares regression.\\n    *   **Normal Q-Q Plot:**  This plot assesses the normality of the residuals. If the residuals are normally distributed, the points should fall approximately along a straight diagonal line. Deviations from the line, especially at the ends, suggest non-normality. If the residuals are not normally distributed, consider transformations of the response variable or using a different model (e.g., a generalized linear model).\\n    *   **Scale-Location Plot (also called Spread-Level Plot):**  This plot (the square root of the absolute value of the standardized residuals vs. fitted values) is another way to assess homoscedasticity. Look for a horizontal line with equally spread points.\\n    *   **Residuals vs. Each Predictor:** Create residual plots of the residuals versus *each* predictor variable in the model. These plots help to identify non-linear relationships that might not be apparent in the residuals vs. fitted values plot. Look for patterns (curves, etc.) in these plots. If you find a pattern, it suggests that you might need to transform the predictor variable or include a non-linear term (e.g., a quadratic term) in the model.\\n\\n*   **Histograms and Boxplots of Residuals:**  These provide a visual check for the distribution of the residuals. A histogram should resemble a normal distribution, and the boxplot should be roughly symmetric with the median near the center of the box.\\n\\n*   **Formal Tests:**\\n    *   **Shapiro-Wilk test:** Can formally test the null hypothesis that the residuals are normally distributed. However, this test can be sensitive to even small deviations from normality, especially with large sample sizes.\\n    *   **Brown-Forsythe or Levene's test:**  Tests for homoscedasticity.  These tests assess whether the variance of the residuals is the same across groups of fitted values.\\n\\n**Important:** Use graphical methods *in conjunction with* formal tests. Graphical methods provide more insight into the *nature* of any violations of the assumptions, which can help you decide how to address them.\\n\\n### 4. Interpretation of the Output:\\n\\n*   **Call:**\\n    *   `lm(formula = Sales ~ . + Income:Advertising + Price:Age, data = carseats)`: This shows the R code used to fit the model.  It indicates that `Sales` is the response variable, and it is modeled as a function of all other variables in the `carseats` data frame (indicated by `.`), plus the interaction between `Income` and `Advertising`, and the interaction between `Price` and `Age`.\\n\\n*   **Residuals:**\\n    *   These are the differences between the actual sales values and the values predicted by the model.\\n    *   `Min: -2.9208`: The smallest residual is -2.9208, meaning the model underestimated sales by 2.9208 thousand units for one store.\\n    *   `1Q: -0.7503`: 25% of the residuals are less than -0.7503.\\n    *   `Median: 0.0177`: The median residual is 0.0177, indicating that the model is, on average, slightly overestimating sales.\\n    *   `3Q: 0.6754`: 75% of the residuals are less than 0.6754.\\n    *   `Max: 3.3413`: The largest residual is 3.3413, meaning the model overestimated sales by 3.3413 thousand units for one store.\\n\\n*   **Coefficients:**\\n    *   This section provides estimates for the coefficients in the linear equation. Each row represents a predictor variable.\\n    *   **Estimate:** The estimated coefficient for the corresponding predictor. It represents the average change in `Sales` for a one-unit increase in the predictor, *holding all other predictors constant*.\\n    *   **Std. Error:** The standard error of the coefficient estimate. It measures the precision of the estimate. Smaller standard errors indicate more precise estimates.\\n    *   **t value:** The t-statistic, calculated as `Estimate / Std. Error`. It measures how many standard errors the coefficient estimate is away from zero.\\n    *   **Pr(>|t|):** The p-value associated with the t-statistic. It's the probability of observing a t-statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one calculated, *assuming that the true coefficient is zero* (i.e., the null hypothesis is true). A small p-value suggests evidence against the null hypothesis.\\n    *   **Signif. codes:** Stars indicating the level of significance. More stars indicate a smaller p-value and stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.\\n\\n    Let's interpret a few specific coefficients, using the provided context for units:\\n\\n    *   `(Intercept) 6.5755654`: This is the estimated sales (in thousands of units) when all predictor variables are equal to zero. While technically part of the model, the intercept is often not directly interpretable, especially when zero values for all predictors are not meaningful.\\n    *   `CompPrice 0.0929371`: For every one-dollar increase in the competitor's price, the car seat sales are estimated to increase by approximately 0.0929 thousand units (92.9 units), *holding all other variables constant*. The p-value is very small (< 2e-16), indicating strong evidence that this effect is statistically significant.\\n    *   `Income 0.0108940`: For every one-thousand-dollar increase in community income, the car seat sales are estimated to increase by approximately 0.0109 thousand units (10.9 units), *holding all other variables constant*. The p-value is 3.57e-05, indicating strong evidence that this effect is statistically significant.\\n    *   `Advertising 0.0702462`: For every one-thousand-dollar increase in the local advertising budget, the car seat sales are estimated to increase by approximately 0.0702 thousand units (70.2 units), *holding all other variables constant*. The p-value is 0.002030, indicating strong evidence that this effect is statistically significant.\\n    *   `Population 0.0001592`: For every one-thousand-person increase in population, the car seat sales are estimated to increase by approximately 0.0001592 thousand units (0.1592 units), *holding all other variables constant*. The p-value is 0.665330, indicating *no* statistically significant evidence that population size is associated with car seat sales.\\n    *   `Price -0.1008064`: For every one-dollar increase in the company's price, the car seat sales are estimated to decrease by approximately 0.1008 thousand units (100.8 units), *holding all other variables constant*. The p-value is very small (< 2e-16), indicating strong evidence that this effect is statistically significant.\\n    *   `ShelveLocGood 4.8486762`: Compared to the baseline level of \\\"Bad\\\" shelf location (which is implicitly captured in the intercept), stores with a \\\"Good\\\" shelf location are estimated to have sales that are 4.8487 thousand units (4848.7 units) *higher*, holding all other variables constant. The p-value is very small (< 2e-16), indicating strong evidence that this effect is statistically significant.\\n    *   `ShelveLocMedium 1.9532620`: Compared to the baseline level of \\\"Bad\\\" shelf location, stores with a \\\"Medium\\\" shelf location are estimated to have sales that are 1.9533 thousand units (1953.3 units) *higher*, holding all other variables constant. The p-value is very small (< 2e-16), indicating strong evidence that this effect is statistically significant.\\n    *   `Age -0.0579466`: For every one-year increase in the average age of the local population, the car seat sales are estimated to decrease by approximately 0.0579 thousand units (57.9 units), *holding all other variables constant*. The p-value is 0.000318, indicating strong evidence that this effect is statistically significant.\\n    *   `Education -0.0208525`: For every one-year increase in the average education level at each location, the car seat sales are estimated to decrease by approximately 0.0209 thousand units (20.9 units), *holding all other variables constant*. The p-value is 0.288361, indicating *no* statistically significant evidence that education level is associated with car seat sales.\\n    *   `UrbanYes 0.1401597`: Stores in urban locations are estimated to have sales that are 0.1402 thousand units (140.2 units) higher than stores in non-urban locations, *holding all other variables constant*. The p-value is 0.213171, indicating *no* statistically significant evidence that being in an urban location is associated with car seat sales.\\n    *   `USYes -0.1575571`: Stores in the US are estimated to have sales that are 0.1576 thousand units (157.6 units) lower than stores not in the US, *holding all other variables constant*. The p-value is 0.290729, indicating *no* statistically significant evidence that being in the US is associated with car seat sales.\\n    *   `Income:Advertising 0.0007510`: This is the interaction term between income and advertising. It suggests that the effect of advertising on sales depends on the level of income. Specifically, for every one-thousand-dollar increase in income, the effect of a one-thousand-dollar increase in advertising on sales *increases* by 0.000751 thousand units (0.751 units). The p-value is 0.007290, indicating statistically significant evidence of an interaction between income and advertising.\\n    *   `Price:Age 0.0001068`: This is the interaction term between price and age. It suggests that the effect of price on sales depends on the average age of the local population. Because the p-value is 0.423812, there is *no* statistically significant evidence of an interaction between price and age.\\n\\n*   **Residual standard error: 1.011 on 386 degrees of freedom**\\n    *   This estimates the standard deviation of the error term. It represents the average amount that the actual sales values deviate from the values predicted by the model. In this case, the typical difference between the observed and predicted sales is about 1.011 thousand units.\\n    *   The degrees of freedom (386) is the number of observations (400) minus the number of coefficients estimated in the model (14).\\n\\n*   **Multiple R-squared: 0.8761, Adjusted R-squared: 0.8719**\\n    *   **Multiple R-squared:** This represents the proportion of the variance in `Sales` that is explained by the model. In this case, 87.61% of the variance in sales is explained by the predictor variables in the model.\\n    *   **Adjusted R-squared:** This is a modified version of R-squared that adjusts for the number of predictors in the model. It penalizes the inclusion of unnecessary predictors. In this case, the adjusted R-squared is 0.8719, which is very close to the multiple R-squared, suggesting that the predictors in the model are all contributing meaningfully to explaining the variance in sales.\\n\\n*   **F-statistic: 210 on 13 and 386 DF, p-value: < 2.2e-16**\\n    *   The F-statistic tests the overall significance of the model. It tests the null hypothesis that *all* of the coefficients (except the intercept) are equal to zero.\\n    *   The very small p-value (< 2.2e-16) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, meaning that at least one of the predictor variables is significantly related to `Sales`.\\n\\n### 5.

Summary of the Statistical Model: #>  #> *   **Name:** This is a linear regression model. #> *   **Purpose:** Linear regression is used to model the relationship between a continuous response variable (in this case, `Sales`) and one or more predictor variables (also known as independent variables). The goal is to find the best-fitting linear equation to describe how the response variable changes with changes in the predictor variables. In this case, the model attempts to explain and predict car seat sales based on factors like competitor price, income, advertising budget, population, the company's own price, shelf location, age, education, urban/rural location, US location, and also considers the interactions between income and advertising, as well as price and age. #> *   **Key Assumptions:** Linear regression relies on several key assumptions: #>     *   **Linearity:** The relationship between the predictors and the response is linear. #>     *   **Independence:** The errors (residuals) are independent of each other. This means that the error for one observation should not predict the error for another observation. #>     *   **Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance):** The variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the predictor variables. In simpler terms, the spread of the residuals should be roughly the same for all predicted values. #>     *   **Normality:** The errors are normally distributed. This assumption is most important for hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals. #>  #> ### 2. Appropriateness of the Statistical Model: #>  #> Based on the description of the data and variables, linear regression *might* be appropriate. The response variable, `Sales`, is continuous, which is suitable for linear regression. The predictor variables are a mix of continuous (e.g., `Income`, `Advertising`, `Price`, `Age`) and categorical variables (e.g., `ShelveLoc`, `Urban`, `US`), which can be accommodated in a linear regression model. The interaction terms `Income:Advertising` and `Price:Age` allow for the possibility that the effect of `Income` depends on the level of `Advertising`, and that the effect of `Price` depends on `Age`. #>  #> However, it is important to examine whether the linearity assumption holds for all the continuous predictors. While categorical predictors can be used directly, the continuous variables require further investigation to ensure a linear relationship. Visualizations (explained in the next section) are essential. #>  #> ### 3. Suggestions for Checking Assumptions of the Statistical Model: #>  #> It is crucial to check the assumptions of the linear regression model to ensure the validity of the results. Here's how: #>  #> *   **Residual Plots:**  These are the most important diagnostic tools. #>     *   **Residuals vs. Fitted Values:**  This plot helps assess linearity and homoscedasticity. #>         *   *Linearity:* Look for a random scatter of points around zero.  A non-linear pattern (e.g., a curve) suggests that the linear model is not appropriate and that a transformation of the predictors or the response variable might be needed. #>         *   *Homoscedasticity:*  The spread of the residuals should be roughly constant across the range of fitted values.  Funnel shapes (where the spread increases or decreases as the fitted values change) indicate heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance).  If you observe heteroscedasticity, consider transforming the response variable (e.g., using a logarithmic transformation) or using weighted least squares regression. #>     *   **Normal Q-Q Plot:**  This plot assesses the normality of the residuals. If the residuals are normally distributed, the points should fall approximately along a straight diagonal line. Deviations from the line, especially at the ends, suggest non-normality. If the residuals are not normally distributed, consider transformations of the response variable or using a different model (e.g., a generalized linear model). #>     *   **Scale-Location Plot (also called Spread-Level Plot):**  This plot (the square root of the absolute value of the standardized residuals vs. fitted values) is another way to assess homoscedasticity. Look for a horizontal line with equally spread points. #>     *   **Residuals vs. Each Predictor:** Create residual plots of the residuals versus *each* predictor variable in the model. These plots help to identify non-linear relationships that might not be apparent in the residuals vs. fitted values plot. Look for patterns (curves, etc.) in these plots. If you find a pattern, it suggests that you might need to transform the predictor variable or include a non-linear term (e.g., a quadratic term) in the model. #>  #> *   **Histograms and Boxplots of Residuals:**  These provide a visual check for the distribution of the residuals. A histogram should resemble a normal distribution, and the boxplot should be roughly symmetric with the median near the center of the box. #>  #> *   **Formal Tests:** #>     *   **Shapiro-Wilk test:** Can formally test the null hypothesis that the residuals are normally distributed. However, this test can be sensitive to even small deviations from normality, especially with large sample sizes. #>     *   **Brown-Forsythe or Levene's test:**  Tests for homoscedasticity.  These tests assess whether the variance of the residuals is the same across groups of fitted values. #>  #> **Important:** Use graphical methods *in conjunction with* formal tests. Graphical methods provide more insight into the *nature* of any violations of the assumptions, which can help you decide how to address them. #>  #> ### 4. Interpretation of the Output: #>  #> *   **Call:** #>     *   `lm(formula = Sales ~ . + Income:Advertising + Price:Age, data = carseats)`: This shows the R code used to fit the model.  It indicates that `Sales` is the response variable, and it is modeled as a function of all other variables in the `carseats` data frame (indicated by `.`), plus the interaction between `Income` and `Advertising`, and the interaction between `Price` and `Age`. #>  #> *   **Residuals:** #>     *   These are the differences between the actual sales values and the values predicted by the model. #>     *   `Min: -2.9208`: The smallest residual is -2.9208, meaning the model underestimated sales by 2.9208 thousand units for one store. #>     *   `1Q: -0.7503`: 25% of the residuals are less than -0.7503. #>     *   `Median: 0.0177`: The median residual is 0.0177, indicating that the model is, on average, slightly overestimating sales. #>     *   `3Q: 0.6754`: 75% of the residuals are less than 0.6754. #>     *   `Max: 3.3413`: The largest residual is 3.3413, meaning the model overestimated sales by 3.3413 thousand units for one store. #>  #> *   **Coefficients:** #>     *   This section provides estimates for the coefficients in the linear equation. Each row represents a predictor variable. #>     *   **Estimate:** The estimated coefficient for the corresponding predictor. It represents the average change in `Sales` for a one-unit increase in the predictor, *holding all other predictors constant*. #>     *   **Std. Error:** The standard error of the coefficient estimate. It measures the precision of the estimate. Smaller standard errors indicate more precise estimates. #>     *   **t value:** The t-statistic, calculated as `Estimate / Std. Error`. It measures how many standard errors the coefficient estimate is away from zero. #>     *   **Pr(>|t|):** The p-value associated with the t-statistic. It's the probability of observing a t-statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one calculated, *assuming that the true coefficient is zero* (i.e., the null hypothesis is true). A small p-value suggests evidence against the null hypothesis. #>     *   **Signif. codes:** Stars indicating the level of significance. More stars indicate a smaller p-value and stronger evidence against the null hypothesis. #>  #>     Let's interpret a few specific coefficients, using the provided context for units: #>  #>     *   `(Intercept) 6.5755654`: This is the estimated sales (in thousands of units) when all predictor variables are equal to zero. While technically part of the model, the intercept is often not directly interpretable, especially when zero values for all predictors are not meaningful. #>     *   `CompPrice 0.0929371`: For every one-dollar increase in the competitor's price, the car seat sales are estimated to increase by approximately 0.0929 thousand units (92.9 units), *holding all other variables constant*. The p-value is very small (< 2e-16), indicating strong evidence that this effect is statistically significant. #>     *   `Income 0.0108940`: For every one-thousand-dollar increase in community income, the car seat sales are estimated to increase by approximately 0.0109 thousand units (10.9 units), *holding all other variables constant*. The p-value is 3.57e-05, indicating strong evidence that this effect is statistically significant. #>     *   `Advertising 0.0702462`: For every one-thousand-dollar increase in the local advertising budget, the car seat sales are estimated to increase by approximately 0.0702 thousand units (70.2 units), *holding all other variables constant*. The p-value is 0.002030, indicating strong evidence that this effect is statistically significant. #>     *   `Population 0.0001592`: For every one-thousand-person increase in population, the car seat sales are estimated to increase by approximately 0.0001592 thousand units (0.1592 units), *holding all other variables constant*. The p-value is 0.665330, indicating *no* statistically significant evidence that population size is associated with car seat sales. #>     *   `Price -0.1008064`: For every one-dollar increase in the company's price, the car seat sales are estimated to decrease by approximately 0.1008 thousand units (100.8 units), *holding all other variables constant*. The p-value is very small (< 2e-16), indicating strong evidence that this effect is statistically significant. #>     *   `ShelveLocGood 4.8486762`: Compared to the baseline level of \"Bad\" shelf location (which is implicitly captured in the intercept), stores with a \"Good\" shelf location are estimated to have sales that are 4.8487 thousand units (4848.7 units) *higher*, holding all other variables constant. The p-value is very small (< 2e-16), indicating strong evidence that this effect is statistically significant. #>     *   `ShelveLocMedium 1.9532620`: Compared to the baseline level of \"Bad\" shelf location, stores with a \"Medium\" shelf location are estimated to have sales that are 1.9533 thousand units (1953.3 units) *higher*, holding all other variables constant. The p-value is very small (< 2e-16), indicating strong evidence that this effect is statistically significant. #>     *   `Age -0.0579466`: For every one-year increase in the average age of the local population, the car seat sales are estimated to decrease by approximately 0.0579 thousand units (57.9 units), *holding all other variables constant*. The p-value is 0.000318, indicating strong evidence that this effect is statistically significant. #>     *   `Education -0.0208525`: For every one-year increase in the average education level at each location, the car seat sales are estimated to decrease by approximately 0.0209 thousand units (20.9 units), *holding all other variables constant*. The p-value is 0.288361, indicating *no* statistically significant evidence that education level is associated with car seat sales. #>     *   `UrbanYes 0.1401597`: Stores in urban locations are estimated to have sales that are 0.1402 thousand units (140.2 units) higher than stores in non-urban locations, *holding all other variables constant*. The p-value is 0.213171, indicating *no* statistically significant evidence that being in an urban location is associated with car seat sales. #>     *   `USYes -0.1575571`: Stores in the US are estimated to have sales that are 0.1576 thousand units (157.6 units) lower than stores not in the US, *holding all other variables constant*. The p-value is 0.290729, indicating *no* statistically significant evidence that being in the US is associated with car seat sales. #>     *   `Income:Advertising 0.0007510`: This is the interaction term between income and advertising. It suggests that the effect of advertising on sales depends on the level of income. Specifically, for every one-thousand-dollar increase in income, the effect of a one-thousand-dollar increase in advertising on sales *increases* by 0.000751 thousand units (0.751 units). The p-value is 0.007290, indicating statistically significant evidence of an interaction between income and advertising. #>     *   `Price:Age 0.0001068`: This is the interaction term between price and age. It suggests that the effect of price on sales depends on the average age of the local population. Because the p-value is 0.423812, there is *no* statistically significant evidence of an interaction between price and age. #>  #> *   **Residual standard error: 1.011 on 386 degrees of freedom** #>     *   This estimates the standard deviation of the error term. It represents the average amount that the actual sales values deviate from the values predicted by the model. In this case, the typical difference between the observed and predicted sales is about 1.011 thousand units. #>     *   The degrees of freedom (386) is the number of observations (400) minus the number of coefficients estimated in the model (14). #>  #> *   **Multiple R-squared: 0.8761, Adjusted R-squared: 0.8719** #>     *   **Multiple R-squared:** This represents the proportion of the variance in `Sales` that is explained by the model. In this case, 87.61% of the variance in sales is explained by the predictor variables in the model. #>     *   **Adjusted R-squared:** This is a modified version of R-squared that adjusts for the number of predictors in the model. It penalizes the inclusion of unnecessary predictors. In this case, the adjusted R-squared is 0.8719, which is very close to the multiple R-squared, suggesting that the predictors in the model are all contributing meaningfully to explaining the variance in sales. #>  #> *   **F-statistic: 210 on 13 and 386 DF, p-value: < 2.2e-16** #>     *   The F-statistic tests the overall significance of the model. It tests the null hypothesis that *all* of the coefficients (except the intercept) are equal to zero. #>     *   The very small p-value (< 2.2e-16) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, meaning that at least one of the predictor variables is significantly related to `Sales`. #>  #> ### 5.

Summary of the Statistical Model: #>  #> *   **Name:** This is a linear regression model. #> *   **Purpose:** The model's purpose is to understand and predict the relationship between `Sales` (unit sales of child car seats) and various factors, including competitor price, income, advertising budget, population, the company's own price, shelf location, average age of the local population, education level, urban/rural location, US location, and interaction effects between income and advertising, and price and age. #> *   **Key Assumptions:** #>     *   **Linearity:** The relationship between the predictors and `Sales` is linear. #>     *   **Independence:** The errors (residuals) are independent of each other. #>     *   **Homoscedasticity:** The variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the predictors. #>     *   **Normality:** The errors are normally distributed. #>  #> ### 2. Appropriateness of the Statistical Model: #>  #> Given the context, linear regression appears to be a reasonable starting point for modeling the relationship between `Sales` and the other variables. `Sales` is a continuous variable, making linear regression a potential candidate. The model includes both continuous and categorical predictors, which linear regression can handle. The inclusion of interaction terms allows for more complex relationships between variables. #>  #> However, the appropriateness of linear regression depends heavily on whether its assumptions are met. Linearity, in particular, should be carefully examined using residual plots. Furthermore, since the response variable is bounded below by zero, a generalized linear model like a Gamma GLM with a log link might be a better choice. #>  #> ### 3. Suggestions for Checking Assumptions of the Statistical Model: #>  #> *   **Residual Plots:** #>     *   **Residuals vs. Fitted Values:** Crucial for checking linearity and homoscedasticity. A random scatter of points suggests linearity; a funnel shape suggests heteroscedasticity. #>     *   **Normal Q-Q Plot:** Assess the normality of residuals. Points falling along a straight line indicate normality. #>     *   **Scale-Location Plot:** Another way to assess homoscedasticity. Look for a horizontal line with equally spread points. #>     *   **Residuals vs. Each Predictor:** To identify non-linear relationships between residuals and each predictor. #>  #> *   **Histograms and Boxplots of Residuals:** Visual checks for the distribution of the residuals, aiming for a roughly normal distribution. #>  #> *   **Formal Tests:** #>     *   **Shapiro-Wilk test:** Test for normality, but be cautious with large sample sizes. #>     *   **Brown-Forsythe or Levene's test:** Tests for homoscedasticity. #>  #> ### 4.
