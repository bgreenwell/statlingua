## Introduction

Statistical models provide powerful insights, but their output can often be dense and filled with technical jargon. Understanding coefficients, p-values, and model fit statistics requires a certain level of expertise, making it challenging to communicate these findings to a broader audience.

The **statlingua** R package aims to bridge this gap. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert complex statistical output into straightforward, understandable, and context-aware natural language descriptions. By feeding your statistical model objects into **statlingua**, you can effortlessly produce human-readable interpretations, thereby democratizing statistical understanding for individuals with varying levels of technical expertise.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1.  The **statlingua** package installed.
2.  The [**ellmer**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ellmer) package installed, as **statlingua** uses it to interface with LLMs.
3.  Access to an LLM provider (e.g., [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/) or [Google Gemini AI](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs)) and an associated API key. You'll need to configure your API key according to the **ellmer** package's documentation (usually by setting environment variables like `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`).
4.  For running the examples in this vignette, you'll also need the **ISLR2** package for the `Carseats` data set.

You can install these packages from CRAN:
```R
# install.packages(c("ellmer", "ISLR2"))
```

Next, let's load **statlingua** for use:

``` r
library(statlingua)
```

## Explaining Statistical Model Output

The core function in **statlingua** is `explain()`. This is a generic function that you can apply to various statistical objects (e.g., the output from `lm()` or `t.test()`).

**statlingua** works by:
1.  Taking your R statistical object.
2.  Internally summarizing the key components of this object.
3.  Constructing a specialized prompt for an LLM, including this summary and any additional context you provide.
4.  Sending this prompt to an LLM via the **ellmer** package.
5.  Returning the LLM's natural language explanation.

### A Basic Example: Linear Regression

Let's use a linear model to predict `Sales` of child car seats from various predictors in the `Carseats` data set (from the **ISLR2** package). This example is adapted from [James et al. (2023)](https://www.statlearning.com/).

First, we'll load the data and fit the model:

``` r
# Ensure ISLR2 is loaded or use ISLR2::Carseats
# library(ISLR2) # Or ensure ISLR2::Carseats is accessible
carseats <- ISLR2::Carseats
fm <- lm(Sales ~ . + Income:Advertising + Price:Age, data = carseats)
summary(fm)  # print a verbose summary

#> Call:
#> lm(formula = Sales ~ . + Income:Advertising + Price:Age, data = carseats)

```

### The Power of Context

At this point, we could directly ask **statlingua** to explain the model `fm`. However, the explanations become significantly more insightful if we provide context about our data and research goals. This is done using the `context` argument in the `explain()` function.

LLMs are powerful, but they don't inherently understand the specifics of your research, the precise meaning of your variables (e.g., "CompPrice" could mean anything without context), or the units of your data unless you provide that information. The `context` argument is your way to give the LLM this crucial background.

Effective `context` can include:

* **Research Objective**: What specific question(s) are you trying to answer with your model? (e.g., "We want to understand the key drivers of car seat sales.")
* **Data Description**:
    * What do your variables represent? (e.g., "`CompPrice` is the price charged by a competitor at each location.")
    * What are their units? (e.g., "Income is in thousands of dollars.")
    * Are there any known characteristics or limitations of the data? (e.g., "The data were recorded in the 1920s," or "This is a simulated data set.")
* **Study Design Insights**: How was the data collected? (e.g., "Data from a cross-sectional survey of 400 stores.")
* **Target Audience (Implicitly)**: While not a formal parameter, if you mention your audience in the context (e.g., "explain this to a non-statistical audience"), it can help the LLM tailor its language.

By supplying such details, you guide the LLM to:

* Interpret coefficients with their **true meaning** (e.g., relating "CompPrice" to actual competitor pricing).
* Relate findings **directly to your research goals**.
* Offer more **pertinent advice** on model assumptions or limitations.
* Generate more **targeted, less generic, and ultimately more useful explanations**.

For our `Carseats` example, here's some relevant context:


``` r
carseats_context <- "
The model uses a data set on child car seat sales at 400 different stores.
The goal is to identify factors associated with sales.
The variables are:
  * Sales: Unit sales (in thousands) at each location (the response variable).
  * CompPrice: Price charged by competitor at each location.
  * Income: Community income level (in thousands of dollars).
  * Advertising: Local advertising budget for the company at each location (in thousands of dollars).
  * Population: Population size in the region (in thousands).
  * Price: Price the company charges for car seats at each site.
  * ShelveLoc: A factor with levels 'Bad', 'Good', and 'Medium' indicating the quality of the shelving location.
  * Age: Average age of the local population.
  * Education: Education level at each location.
  * Urban: A factor ('No', 'Yes') indicating if the store is in an urban or rural location.
  * US: A factor ('No', 'Yes') indicating if the store is in the US.
The data set is simulated.
"
```

### Getting the Explanation

Now, let's initialize an **ellmer** client (here, using Google Gemini) and call `explain()` with our model object (`fm`) and the `carseats_context`.

**Note on API Keys:** The following code assumes you have set up your Google API key for `ellmer`. Please refer to the **ellmer** documentation for details on API key configuration.


``` r
# Initialize the LLM client (ensure your API key is configured)
# The 'echo="none"' argument suppresses printing of prompts/responses by ellmer itself
# as statlingua will manage this.
client <- ellmer::chat_google_gemini(echo = "none")

# Get the explanation
explanation_output <- explain(fm, client = client, context = carseats_context)

# By default, explain() returns a character string.
# We'll print the first few characters to see.
# The full explanation can be long.
cat(substr(explanation_output, 1, 200), "...\n")
#> Here's an explanation of the provided linear regression model output, based on the car seat sales data.
#> 
#> ### 1. Summary of the statistical model:
#> 
#> *   **Statistical Model:** This output represents a * ...
```

The explanation from the LLM can vary slightly each time you run it.

### Displaying the Explanation

The `explain()` function returns a single character string. This string is often formatted by the LLM using Markdown, which includes special characters for structure (like newline characters `\n` for paragraphs and headings, and spaces for lists).

For better readability in the R console, it's often best to pass the output of `explain()` into R's built-in `cat()` function. This will interpret the Markdown formatting (like line breaks). This is also essential for rendering the output correctly in R Markdown documents.

Alternatively, **statlingua** provides a `concatenate = TRUE` argument within the `explain()` function for convenience. Setting this will cause `explain()` to print the formatted explanation directly to the console (similar to using `cat()`) and return the explanation string invisibly.

The following two calls are effectively equivalent in how they display the output:


``` r
# Option 1: Using cat()
explain(fm, client = client, context = carseats_context) |> cat()

# Option 2: Using concatenate = TRUE
explain(fm, client = client, context = carseats_context, concatenate = TRUE)
```

Here's the actual formatted output using `concatenate = TRUE` (the LLM's detailed explanation will appear between the horizontal rules):

---

I see you have provided the same linear regression model output and context as before. Would you like me to proceed as before and explain the provided output and context again? Or do you have new instructions?

### Inspecting the LLM Interaction

If you want to see the exact prompts sent to the LLM and the raw response, you can print the `client` object that you passed to `explain()`. After a chat, the **ellmer** client object stores:

1.  The system prompt (which **statlingua** sets to guide the LLM's role and response format).
2.  The user query (constructed by **statlingua** from your model output and context).
3.  The LLM's response.


``` r
# The client object now contains the history of the last interaction
print(client)
<Chat Google/Gemini/gemini-2.0-flash turns=5 tokens=9634/4714 $0.00>

## Role

You are an expert statistician and R programmer with a gift for teaching and explaining complex concepts simply. Your primary function is to interpret and explain the output generated by linear models performed using the R function `lm()`. You understand the nuances of these models, their underlying assumptions, and how their results relate to real-world research questions.

## Clarity and Tone

Your explanations must be clear, patient, and easy for someone without a strong statistics background to understand. Avoid technical jargon where possible, or explain it clearly if necessary. Use analogies or simple examples if they aid understanding. Maintain a formal, informative, and encouraging tone suitable for educational purposes. The focus is on conveying the *meaning* and *implications* of the statistical results, not just restating the numbers.

## Response Format

Your response must be structured using Markdown, employing headings, bullet points, and code formatting where appropriate.

## Instructions

Based on the provided R statistical model output and any accompanying context about the data or research question, generate a comprehensive explanation following these steps:

1.  **Summary of the statistical model:**
    * Clearly state the name of the statistical model (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, Poisson regression with log link, etc.).
    * Briefly explain the **purpose** of this type of model.
    * List the **key assumptions** required for this statistical model to be valid.

2.  **Appropriateness of the statistical model (conditional):**
    * **If additional context and background information about the data, study design, or research question is provided:** Comment on whether the chosen statistical model appears appropriate *based on the provided context*. Relate the appropriateness back to the assumptions of the model and the type of data described. If the context suggests the model might *not* be appropriate, gently point this out and briefly explain why, based on the assumptions.
    * **If no additional context is provided, or the provided context is insufficient to assess appropriateness:** State clearly that you cannot comment on the appropriateness of the statistical model due to the lack of necessary background information about the data and study design.

3.  **Suggestions for checking assumptions of the statistical model:**
    * Suggest practical ways (e.g., regression diagnostics) the analyst can check the key assumptions of the statistical model used.
    * **Strongly recommend graphical methods** for checking assumptions (e.g., histograms, boxplots, quantile-quantile plots for normality, scatter plots for linearity/homoscedasticity, and, most importantly, residual plots).
    * Suggest various residual plots the analyst could use to check for appropriate transformations of the predictors and response variable.
    * Briefly explain *what* the analyst should look for in these plots to assess the assumption.
    * Mention formal statistical tests for assumptions (like the Brown-Forsythe test for non-constant variance) but advise using them *in conjunction* with graphical methods, as graphical methods often provide more insight into the nature of any violations.

4.  **Interpretation of the output:**
    * Use separate bullet points or a clear list format to interpret each important piece of the provided statistical output (e.g., each coefficient in the model).
    * For each component (e.g., coefficient, standard error, p-value, deviance, etc.), explain **what the number represents** in the context of the model and the data.
    * **If variable units are provided in the context, use those units** when interpreting coefficients.
    * When interpreting the **p-value**, provide a clear, non-technical explanation. Emphasize that it is the probability of observing data as extreme as, or more extreme than, the data you have, *assuming the null hypothesis is true*. **Do not state that the p-value is the probability that the null hypothesis is true or false.** Explain that a small p-value suggests the observed data are unlikely if the null hypothesis is true, providing evidence *against* the null hypothesis.
    
5.  **Caution:**
    * Conclude the response with a clear statement that this explanation was generated by a Large Language Model. Advise the user to critically review the output and consult additional statistical resources or experts to ensure correctness and a full understanding.

**Constraint:** Focus solely on interpreting the *output* of the statistical model and providing explanations relevant to that output and the model's requirements. Do not perform new calculations or suggest alternative analyses unless directly prompted by assessing the appropriateness based on provided context.

Here's an explanation of the provided linear regression model output, based on the car seat sales data.

### 1. Summary of the statistical model:

*   **Statistical Model:** This output represents a **linear regression model**.
*   **Purpose:** Linear regression models are used to examine the relationship between a continuous response variable (in this case, `Sales`) and one or more predictor variables (like `Price`, `Income`, `Advertising`, etc.). The goal is to understand how changes in the predictors are associated with changes in the response.
*   **Key Assumptions:**
    *   **Linearity:** The relationship between the predictors and the response is linear.
    *   **Independence:** The errors (residuals) are independent of each other.
    *   **Homoscedasticity:** The errors have constant variance across all levels of the predictors.
    *   **Normality:** The errors are normally distributed.

### 2. Appropriateness of the statistical model:

Based on the description of the data, a linear regression model seems like a reasonable starting point.  `Sales` is a continuous variable, and we're interested in how it relates to other variables.  However, it's important to consider the following:

*   **Potential Non-Linearity:** Some relationships might not be linear. For example, the effect of `Advertising` on `Sales` might plateau at higher levels. The interaction term `Income:Advertising` in this model suggests an initial concern about non-linearity in this relationship, so that is good.
*   **Interactions:** The model includes interactions between `Income` and `Advertising`, and between `Price` and `Age`, which allows the effect of one variable to depend on the level of another. This is a good idea if you suspect such interactions exist.
*   **Categorical Predictors:** The variables `ShelveLoc`, `Urban`, and `US` are categorical, and the linear model can handle these by creating indicator variables (also called dummy variables). This is appropriate.
*   **Range Restrictions:** The sales data is recorded in thousands of units. It is possible that there are theoretical lower and upper bounds on the number of sales, depending on the population of each location and how many car seats are available, for example. If the sales data is constrained in this way, linear regression may be inappropriate, as the model assumes the response is continuous without bounds.

### 3. Suggestions for checking assumptions of the statistical model:

It is *critical* to check the assumptions of the linear regression model *after* fitting it. Here are some ways to do this, with an emphasis on graphical methods:

*   **Linearity:**
    *   **Residual Plots:** Plot the residuals against each predictor variable individually.  Look for non-random patterns in the residuals (e.g., a curve, a funnel shape). These patterns suggest a non-linear relationship or the need for a transformation. If curvature is apparent in the residuals, this may indicate the need to include polynomial terms (e.g., $Advertising^2$), or transformations of the predictors (e.g., $log(Advertising)$).
    *   **Component + Residual Plots:** These plots can help visualize the linearity assumption for each predictor, especially when there are multiple predictors in the model.

*   **Independence:**
    *   **Residual vs. Order Plot:** If the data were collected over time, plot the residuals against the order in which the data were collected. Look for trends or patterns that suggest correlation between residuals.  Since this is cross-sectional data from different stores, this is likely not a major concern.
    *   **Durbin-Watson Test:** This is a formal test for autocorrelation in the residuals.

*   **Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance):**
    *   **Residual Plot:** Plot the residuals against the fitted values. Look for a funnel shape or other patterns that indicate the variance of the residuals is not constant.
    *   **Scale-Location Plot:** This plot (also called a spread-level plot) is similar to the residual plot but can be more sensitive to detecting heteroscedasticity. It plots the square root of the standardized residuals against the fitted values.
    *   **Brown-Forsythe Test:** This is a formal test for homoscedasticity.  It's more robust than the Bartlett test when the data are not perfectly normally distributed.

*   **Normality:**
    *   **Histogram of Residuals:** Check if the distribution of the residuals is approximately normal.
    *   **QQ-Plot:** This plot compares the quantiles of the residuals to the theoretical quantiles of a normal distribution. If the residuals are normally distributed, the points should fall close to a straight line. Deviations from the line indicate departures from normality.
    *   **Shapiro-Wilk Test:** This is a formal test for normality.  However, be cautious about relying solely on this test, especially with large sample sizes, as it can be overly sensitive.

*   **Outliers and Influential Points:**
    *   **Cook's Distance:** Identify observations that have a disproportionate influence on the regression results.
    *   **Leverage Values:** Identify observations with extreme values on the predictor variables.
    *   **DFBETAS:** Measure the effect of deleting each observation on the estimated regression coefficients.
*   **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):**
    *   **VIF Values:** Check for multicollinearity among the predictor variables. Values exceeding 5 or 10 may indicate strong collinearity.

If the assumptions are violated, consider data transformations (e.g., log transformation of `Sales` if it's right-skewed), adding interaction terms or polynomial terms, or using a different type of model (e.g., a generalized linear model).

### 4. Interpretation of the output:

*   **Call:** `lm(formula = Sales ~ . + Income:Advertising + Price:Age, data = carseats)`
    *   This shows the R command used to fit the linear model.  `Sales` is the response variable, and all other variables in the `carseats` data set are included as predictors (`.`).  Additionally, interaction terms between `Income` and `Advertising`, and `Price` and `Age` were included.

*   **Residuals:**
    *   This section provides a summary of the distribution of the residuals (the differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the model).
    *   `Min`: The smallest residual is -2.9208 (thousands of units).
    *   `1Q`: 25% of the residuals are less than -0.7503 (thousands of units).
    *   `Median`: The median residual is 0.0177 (thousands of units). This suggests that the model is, on average, doing a good job of predicting sales.
    *   `3Q`: 75% of the residuals are less than 0.6754 (thousands of units).
    *   `Max`: The largest residual is 3.3413 (thousands of units).
    *   *Ideally, the residuals should be symmetrically distributed around zero.* The median being close to zero is a good sign. The Min and Max give a sense of the range of errors.

*   **Coefficients:**
    *   This section provides the estimated coefficients for each predictor in the model, along with their standard errors, t-values, and p-values.  Let's go through them one by one.  Remember that *Sales* is measured in thousands of units, *Income* and *Advertising* are measured in thousands of dollars, *Population* is measured in thousands of people, and *Price* is measured in dollars.
    *   `(Intercept) 8.8341795  0.9995001   8.839  < 2e-16 ***`
        *   `Estimate`: 8.8341795. This is the estimated sales (in thousands of units) when all other predictors are equal to zero. Note that in many cases this interpretation isn't practically meaningful because it might not make sense for all predictors to be zero simultaneously.
        *   `Std. Error`: 0.9995001. This is the standard error of the intercept estimate. It measures the uncertainty in the estimate of the intercept.
        *   `t value`: 8.839.  This is the t-statistic, calculated as the estimate divided by its standard error.
        *   `Pr(>|t|)`: < 2e-16. This is the p-value.  It's extremely small, meaning that if the true intercept were zero, the probability of observing a t-statistic as extreme as 8.839 (or more extreme) is virtually zero.  This provides very strong evidence that the intercept is not zero.
    *   `CompPrice 0.0929371  0.0041183  22.567  < 2e-16 ***`

## Additional context to consider


The model uses a data set on child car seat sales at 400 different stores.
The goal is to identify factors associated with sales.
The variables are:
  * Sales: Unit sales (in thousands) at each location (the response variable).
  * CompPrice: Price charged by competitor at each location.
  * Income: Community income level (in thousands of dollars).
  * Advertising: Local advertising budget for the company at each location (in thousands of dollars).
  * Population: Population size in the region (in thousands).
  * Price: Price the company charges for car seats at each site.
  * ShelveLoc: A factor with levels 'Bad', 'Good', and 'Medium' indicating the quality of the shelving location.
  * Age: Average age of the local population.
  * Education: Education level at each location.
  * Urban: A factor ('No', 'Yes') indicating if the store is in an urban or rural location.
  * US: A factor ('No', 'Yes') indicating if the store is in the US.
The data set is simulated.

### Follow-up Questions

A powerful feature of using LLMs is their ability to engage in conversation. If the initial explanation sparks further questions, or if you want clarification on a specific part, you can continue the conversation using the same `client` object. Simply use its `$chat()` method with your follow-up question.

For example, to ask for more details about R-squared from the previous explanation:

``` r
msg <- "Elaborate further on the meaning of R-squared in this example, specifically for the Carseats model."
# The client remembers the context of the previous interaction
client$chat(msg) |> cat()
```

Okay, let's delve deeper into the meaning of R-squared and adjusted R-squared in the context of the car seat sales model.

*   **R-squared (Multiple R-squared):** The R-squared value of 0.8761 tells us that approximately 87.61% of the variability in car seat sales (`Sales`) across the 400 stores can be explained by the predictor variables included in this linear regression model. In other words, about 87.61% of the differences in sales levels from store to store can be attributed to factors such as the competitor's price (`CompPrice`), community income (`Income`), advertising budget (`Advertising`), the company's price (`Price`), shelf location (`ShelveLoc`), average age of the local population (`Age`), education level (`Education`), whether the store is in an urban area (`Urban`), whether the store is in the US (`US`), and the interactions between income and advertising, and price and age.

    *   **Practical Interpretation:** Imagine you're trying to understand why some stores sell more car seats than others. This R-squared value suggests that this model does a pretty good job of explaining those differences. Knowing the values of the predictor variables allows you to predict the sales reasonably well. An R-squared of 0 would mean that the predictor variables are useless in predicting sales. An R-squared of 1 would mean that all of the predictor variables perfectly predict the sales levels.

    *   **Caveats:**
        *   **Correlation vs. Causation:** R-squared only indicates how well the model *fits* the data. It does *not* imply causation. Just because these variables are associated with sales doesn't necessarily mean that changing advertising will *cause* sales to increase, or that setting a particular price will *cause* sales to decrease. There could be other factors at play, or the relationships could be more complex.
        *   **Overfitting:** A high R-squared doesn't automatically mean the model is *good*. It's possible to "overfit" the data by including too many predictors, especially if some of them are not truly related to the response. Overfitting leads to a model that performs well on the data it was trained on but poorly on new data. This is why the adjusted R-squared is important.

*   **Adjusted R-squared:** The adjusted R-squared (0.8719) is a modification of R-squared that penalizes the addition of predictors that don't significantly improve the model's fit. It is always less than or equal to R-squared.

    *   **Purpose of Adjustment:** R-squared will always increase (or stay the same) as you add more variables to a model, even if those variables are just random noise. Adjusted R-squared accounts for this by decreasing if a new variable doesn't add enough explanatory power to offset the increase in model complexity (i.e., the number of parameters).

    *   **Interpretation in This Case:** The adjusted R-squared is only slightly lower than the R-squared, which suggests that the predictors included in the model are, on balance, contributing meaningful information about car seat sales. If the adjusted R-squared were substantially lower than the R-squared, it would indicate that some of the predictors might be superfluous and that a simpler model might be preferable.

    *   **Model Comparison:** Adjusted R-squared is particularly useful when comparing models with different numbers of predictors. When choosing between two models, the one with the higher adjusted R-squared is generally preferred (all else being equal).

*   **In Summary:** The R-squared and adjusted R-squared values for this car seat sales model suggest that the model explains a large proportion of the variance in sales, and that the included predictors are, for the most part, contributing meaningfully to the model's explanatory power. However, it is crucial to remember that these values are just one aspect of model evaluation. It's important to also consider the model's assumptions, the significance of individual predictors, and the potential for overfitting before drawing firm conclusions.

I hope this elaboration is helpful!
